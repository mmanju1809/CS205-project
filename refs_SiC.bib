  abstract={The exploitation of emerging quantum technologies requires efficient fabrication of key building blocks. Sources of single photons are extremely important across many applications as they can serve as vectors for quantum information—thereby allowing long-range (perhaps even global-scale) quantum states to be made and manipulated for tasks such as quantum communication or distributed quantum computation. At the single-emitter level, quantum sources also afford new possibilities in terms of nanoscopy and bio-marking. Color centers in diamond are prominent candidates to generate and manipulate quantum states of light, as they are a photostable solid-state source of single photons at room temperature. In this review, we discuss the state of the art of diamond-based single-photon emitters and highlight their fabrication methodologies. We present the experimental techniques used to characterize the quantum emitters and discuss their photophysical properties. We outline a number of applications including quantum key distribution, bio-marking and sub-diffraction imaging, where diamond-based single emitters are playing a crucial role. We conclude with a discussion of the main challenges and perspectives for employing diamond emitters in quantum information processing.}

  abstract={We present results of ab initio calculations for the electronic and atomic structures of monovacancies and antisite defects in 4H-SiC in all possible charge states. The calculations make use of a plane-wave pseudopotential method based on density-functional theory and the local spin-density approximation. Formation energies, ionization levels, and local geometries of the relaxed structures are reported for defects at all possible cubic and hexagonal lattice sites. To correct for the electrostatic interaction between charged supercells, we use a Madelung-type correction for the formation energies, leading to good agreement with experimentally observed ionization levels. Our calculations indicate no negative- U behaviour for carbon vacancies. Hence, the singly positive charge state of the carbon vacancy V C + is stable, as recently found in experiments. The silicon antisite Si C + is found to be stable at low values of electron chemical potential—again in agreement with experiment.}

abstract ={Identifying and designing physical systems for use as qubits, the basic units of quantum information, are critical steps in the development of a quantum computer. Among the possibilities in the solid state, a defect in diamond known as the nitrogen-vacancy (NV-1) center stands out for its robustness?its quantum state can be initialized, manipulated, and measured with high fidelity at room temperature. Here we describe how to systematically identify other deep center defects with similar quantum-mechanical properties. We present a list of physical criteria that these centers and their hosts should meet and explain how these requirements can be used in conjunction with electronic structure theory to intelligently sort through candidate defect systems. To illustrate these points in detail, we compare electronic structure calculations of the NV-1 center in diamond with those of several deep centers in 4H silicon carbide (SiC). We then discuss the proposed criteria for similar defects in other tetrahedrally coordinated semiconductors.},

Abstract = {A grid-based real-space implementation of the projector augmented wave
   (PAW) method of Blochl {[}Phys. Rev. B 50, 17953 (1994)] for density
   functional theory (DFT) calculations is presented. The use of uniform
   three-dimensional (3D) real-space grids for representing wave
   functions, densities, and potentials allows for flexible boundary
   conditions, efficient multigrid algorithms for solving Poisson and
   Kohn-Sham equations, and efficient parallelization using simple
   real-space domain-decomposition. We use the PAW method to perform
   all-electron calculations in the frozen core approximation, with smooth
   valence wave functions that can be represented on relatively coarse
   grids. We demonstrate the accuracy of the method by calculating the
   atomization energies of 20 small molecules, and the bulk modulus and
   lattice constants of bulk aluminum. We show that the approach in terms
   of computational efficiency is comparable to standard plane-wave
   methods, but the memory requirements are higher.},

  abstract={Electronic structure calculations have become an indispensable tool in many areas of materials science and quantum chemistry. Even though the Kohn–Sham formulation of the density-functional theory (DFT) simplifies the many-body problem significantly, one is still confronted with several numerical challenges. In this article we present the projector augmented-wave (PAW) method as implemented in the GPAW program package ( https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/gpaw [https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/gpaw] ) using a uniform real-space grid representation of the electronic wavefunctions. Compared to more traditional plane wave or localized basis set approaches, real-space grids offer several advantages, most notably good computational scalability and systematic convergence properties. However, as a unique feature GPAW also facilitates a localized atomic-orbital basis set in addition to the grid. The efficient atomic basis set is complementary to the more accurate grid, and the possibility to seamlessly switch between the two representations provides great flexibility. While DFT allows one to study ground state properties, time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT) provides access to the excited states. We have implemented the two common formulations of TDDFT, namely the linear-response and the time propagation schemes. Electron transport calculations under finite-bias conditions can be performed with GPAW using non-equilibrium Green functions and the localized basis set. In addition to the basic features of the real-space PAW method, we also describe the implementation of selected exchange–correlation functionals, parallelization schemes, ΔSCF-method, x-ray absorption spectra, and maximally localized Wannier orbitals.}

Abstract = {The authors have created an object-oriented scripting interface to a mature density functional theory
code. The interface gives users a high-level, flexible handle on the code without rewriting the
underlying number-crunching code. The authors also discuss the design issues and advantages of
homogeneous interfaces},

  abstract={QUANTUM ESPRESSO is an integrated suite of computer codes for electronic-structure calculations and materials modeling, based on density-functional theory, plane waves, and pseudopotentials (norm-conserving, ultrasoft, and projector-augmented wave). The acronym ESPRESSO stands for opEn Source Package for Research in Electronic Structure, Simulation, and Optimization . It is freely available to researchers around the world under the terms of the GNU General Public License. QUANTUM ESPRESSO builds upon newly-restructured electronic-structure codes that have been developed and tested by some of the original authors of novel electronic-structure algorithms and applied in the last twenty years by some of the leading materials modeling groups worldwide. Innovation and efficiency are still its main focus, with special attention paid to massively parallel architectures, and a great effort being devoted to user friendliness. QUANTUM ESPRESSO is evolving towards a distribution of independent and interoperable codes in the spirit of an open-source project, where researchers active in the field of electronic-structure calculations are encouraged to participate in the project by contributing their own codes or by implementing their own ideas into existing codes.}

  abstract={We present first-principles calculations of the quasiparticle band structure of the group IV materials Si and Ge and the group III–V compound semiconductors AlP, AlAs, AlSb, InP, InAs, InSb, GaP, GaAs and GaSb. Calculations are performed using the plane wave pseudopotential method and the ‘one-shot’ G W method,i.e. G 0 W 0 . Quasiparticle band structures, augmented with the effects of spin–orbit, are obtained via a Wannier interpolation of the obtained quasiparticle energies and calculated spin–orbit matrix. Our calculations explicitly treat the shallow semicore states of In and Ga, which are known to be important in the description of the electronic properties, as valence states in the quasiparticle calculation. Our calculated quasiparticle energies, combining both the ab initio evaluation of the electron self-energy and the vector part of the pseudopotential representing the spin–orbit effects, are in generally very good agreement with experimental values. These calculations illustrate the predictive power of the methodology as applied to group IV and III–V semiconductors.}
